# Querylanguage-Project
Project

## Aim of the project
The goal of this analysis is to provide data-driven insights into road accidents, focusing on accident severity, risk factors, vehicle involvement, and environmental conditions.

### Note
- Clean, format and transform the data if need be.
- Clean and readable query attracts more marks.
- Evident use of AI reduces your score.

#### Tasks at hand
1. Accident Severity & Risk Factors
- What is the distribution of accident severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal)?
- How does speed limit impact accident severity?
- What are the most dangerous weather and road conditions for accidents?
- Which days of the week have the highest accident rates?
  
2. Vehicle Involvement & Impact Analysis
- Which vehicle types are involved in the most accidents?
- What is the relationship between vehicle age and accident severity?
- What are the most common points of impact in accidents?
- Are left-hand drive vehicles more likely to be in accidents?

3. Geographic & Environmental Trends
- Are accidents more common in urban or rural areas?
- How do light conditions (Daylight vs. Darkness) affect accident severity?
- Do certain weather conditions lead to higher accident severity?


4. Journey & Driver Behavior Analysis
- What are the most common journey purposes for vehicles involved in accidents?
- Are work-related journeys more prone to severe accidents?
- How does the propulsion type (petrol, diesel, electric) impact accident rate?
  
5. Trend Analysis
- How has the number of accidents changed over time?
